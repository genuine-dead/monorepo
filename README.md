## Genuine Dead Monorepo

The Genuine Dead Project is a coming together heads searching to find a place for The Grateful Deads legacy to live on in the multiverse. 
With an eye towards improving the UX/UI of The Grateful Dead's internet footprint and specifically aiming to archive the music in a decentralized immutable manner so that the music may live on.

This monorepo for the project will be the main repository of findings, collections and ideas.
